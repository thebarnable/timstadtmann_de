Welcome to my landing page!
I am Tim, electrical engineer with 7 years of experience in the design of digital hardware & RTL modules for Xilinx FPGAs, and embedded software development.
In my previous role, I contributed to the specification, design, and implementation of a 35-FPGA cluster based on Xilinx devices for simulating neuroscientific experiments. As one of just two initial team members, I carried significant responsibility and later took on de-facto project leadership, coordinating several student assistants, PhD candidates, and a post-doc.
